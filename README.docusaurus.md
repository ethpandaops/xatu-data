| Dataset Name | Schema | Description | Prefix | EthPandaOps Clickhouse|Public Parquet Files |
|--------------|--------|-------------|--------|---|---|
| **Beacon API Event Stream** | [Schema](/data/xatu/schema/beacon_api_/) | Events derived from the Beacon API event stream. This data is usually useful for 'timing' events, such as when a block was seen by a sentry. Because of this it usually has the same data but from many different instances. These tables are usually fairly slim and contain only a few columns. These tables can be joined with the canonical tables to get a more complete view of the data. For example, you can join the beacon_api_eth_v1_events_block table on block_root or slot with the canonical_beacon_block table to get the block data for each block. | beacon_api_ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Execution Layer P2P** | [Schema](/data/xatu/schema/mempool_/) | Events from the execution layer p2p network. This data is usually useful for 'timing' events, such as when a transaction was seen in the mempool by an instance. Because of this it usually has the same data but from many different instances. | mempool_ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Canonical Beacon** | [Schema](/data/xatu/schema/canonical_beacon_/) | Events derived from the finalized beacon chain. This data is only derived by a single instance, are deduped, and are more complete and reliable than the beacon_api_ tables. These tables can be reliably JOINed on to hydrate other tables with information | canonical_beacon_ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Canonical Execution** | [Schema](/data/xatu/schema/canonical_execution_/) | Data extracted from the execution layer. This data is only derived by a single instance, are deduped, and are more complete and reliable than the execution_layer_p2p tables. These tables can be reliably JOINed on to hydrate other tables with information | canonical_execution_ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Consensus Layer P2P** | [Schema](/data/xatu/schema/libp2p_/) | Events from the consensus layer p2p network. This data is usually useful for 'timing' events, such as when a block was seen by a sentry. Because of this it usually has the same data but from many different instances. | libp2p_ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **MEV Relay** | [Schema](/data/xatu/schema/mev_relay_/) | Events derived from MEV relays. Data is scraped from multiple MEV Relays by multiple instances. | mev_relay_ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **CBT (ClickHouse Build Tools)** | [Schema](/data/xatu/schema/cbt/) | Pre-aggregated analytical tables for common blockchain queries. These tables are transformation tables similar to DBT, powered by [xatu-cbt](https://github.com/ethpandaops/xatu-cbt) using [ClickHouse Build Tools (CBT)](https://github.com/ethpandaops/cbt). |  | ✅ | ❌ |
