  - name: Beacon API Event Stream
    description: Events derived from the Beacon API event stream. This data is usually useful for 'timing' events, such as when a block was seen by a sentry. Because of this it usually has the same data but from many different instances. These tables are usually fairly slim and contain only a few columns. These tables can be joined with the canonical tables to get a more complete view of the data. For example, you can join the beacon_api_eth_v1_events_block table on block_root or slot with the canonical_beacon_block table to get the block data for each block.

    additional_info: "The libp2p dataset captures peer-to-peer network events from the consensus layer, however due to the large volume of network traffic, data is sampled using a sharding strategy. This ensures manageable data sizes while maintaining significance. Not all events are captured - the sampling rate varies by event type and topic, with high-volume topics being more aggressively sampled.\n\n## Event Categorization\n\nEvents are categorized into four groups based on their available sharding keys:\n\n### Group A: Topic + MsgID Events\nEvents with both topic and message ID, enabling full sharding flexibility:\n- `PUBLISH_MESSAGE`, `DELIVER_MESSAGE`, `DUPLICATE_MESSAGE`, `REJECT_MESSAGE`\n- `GOSSIPSUB_BEACON_BLOCK`, `GOSSIPSUB_BEACON_ATTESTATION`, `GOSSIPSUB_BLOB_SIDECAR`\n- `RPC_META_MESSAGE`, `RPC_META_CONTROL_IHAVE`\n\n**Sharding**: Uses message ID for sharding, with topic-based configuration\n\n### Group B: Topic-Only Events\nEvents with only topic information:\n- `JOIN`, `LEAVE`, `GRAFT`, `PRUNE`\n- `RPC_META_CONTROL_GRAFT`, `RPC_META_CONTROL_PRUNE`, `RPC_META_SUBSCRIPTION`\n\n**Sharding**: Uses topic hash for sharding decisions\n\n### Group C: MsgID-Only Events\nEvents with only message ID:\n- `RPC_META_CONTROL_IWANT`, `RPC_META_CONTROL_IDONTWANT`\n\n**Sharding**: Uses message ID with default configuration\n\n### Group D: No Sharding Key Events\nEvents without sharding keys:\n- `ADD_PEER`, `REMOVE_PEER`, `CONNECTED`, `DISCONNECTED`\n- `RECV_RPC`, `SEND_RPC`, `DROP_RPC` (parent events only)\n- `HANDLE_METADATA`, `HANDLE_STATUS`\n\n**Sharding**: All-or-nothing based on configuration\n\n### Sharding Decision Flow\n```\n┌─────────────┐\n│Event Arrives│\n└──────┬──────┘\n       │\n       ▼\n┌──────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐\n│Get Event Info├────►│ Event Category? │\n└──────────────┘     └────────┬────────┘\n                              │\n        ┌─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┬─────────────────────┐\n        ▼                     ▼                     ▼                     ▼\n   ┌─────────┐         ┌─────────┐           ┌─────────┐           ┌─────────┐\n   │ Group A │         │ Group B │           │ Group C │           │ Group D │\n   │Topic+Msg│         │Topic Only│          │Msg Only │           │ No Keys │\n   └────┬────┘         └────┬────┘           └────┬────┘           └────┬────┘\n        │                   │                     │                     │\n        ▼                   ▼                     ▼                     ▼\n   Topic Config?

    additional_info: 'CBT tables are organized by network-specific databases. To query these tables, you must target the correct database for your network:

      - `mainnet.table_name` for Mainnet data

      - `sepolia.table_name` for Sepolia data

      - `holesky.table_name` for Holesky data

      - `hoodi.table_name` for Hoodi data


      Unlike other Xatu datasets, CBT tables do not use `meta_network_name` for filtering. The network is determined by the database you query.


      CBT tables include dimension tables (prefixed with `dim_`), fact tables (prefixed with `fct_`), and intermediate tables (prefixed with `int_`).
