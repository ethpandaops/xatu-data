    description: "Events derived from the Beacon API event stream. This data is usually useful for 'timing' events, such as when a block was seen by a sentry. Because of this it usually has the same data but from many different instances. These tables are usually fairly slim and contain only a few columns. These tables can be joined with the canonical tables to get a more complete view of the data. For example, you can join the beacon_api_eth_v1_events_block table on block_root or slot with the canonical_beacon_block table to get the block data for each block."

    additional_info: |
      The libp2p dataset captures peer-to-peer network events from the consensus layer, however due to the large volume of network traffic, data is sampled using a sharding strategy. This ensures manageable data sizes while maintaining significance. Not all events are captured - the sampling rate varies by event type and topic, with high-volume topics being more aggressively sampled.

      ## Event Categorization

      Events are categorized into four groups based on their available sharding keys:

      ### Group A: Topic + MsgID Events
      Events with both topic and message ID, enabling full sharding flexibility:
      - `PUBLISH_MESSAGE`, `DELIVER_MESSAGE`, `DUPLICATE_MESSAGE`, `REJECT_MESSAGE`
      - `GOSSIPSUB_BEACON_BLOCK`, `GOSSIPSUB_BEACON_ATTESTATION`, `GOSSIPSUB_BLOB_SIDECAR`
      - `RPC_META_MESSAGE`, `RPC_META_CONTROL_IHAVE`

      **Sharding**: Uses message ID for sharding, with topic-based configuration

      ### Group B: Topic-Only Events
      Events with only topic information:
      - `JOIN`, `LEAVE`, `GRAFT`, `PRUNE`
      - `RPC_META_CONTROL_GRAFT`, `RPC_META_CONTROL_PRUNE`, `RPC_META_SUBSCRIPTION`

      **Sharding**: Uses topic hash for sharding decisions

      ### Group C: MsgID-Only Events
      Events with only message ID:
      - `RPC_META_CONTROL_IWANT`, `RPC_META_CONTROL_IDONTWANT`

      **Sharding**: Uses message ID with default configuration

      ### Group D: No Sharding Key Events
      Events without sharding keys:
      - `ADD_PEER`, `REMOVE_PEER`, `CONNECTED`, `DISCONNECTED`
      - `RECV_RPC`, `SEND_RPC`, `DROP_RPC` (parent events only)
      - `HANDLE_METADATA`, `HANDLE_STATUS`

      **Sharding**: All-or-nothing based on configuration

      ### Sharding Decision Flow
