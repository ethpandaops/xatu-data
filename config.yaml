    description: "Events derived from the Beacon API event stream. This data is usually useful for 'timing' events, such as when a block was seen by a sentry. Because of this it usually has the same data but from many different instances. These tables are usually fairly slim and contain only a few columns. These tables can be joined with the canonical tables to get a more complete view of the data. For example, you can join the beacon_api_eth_v1_events_block table on block_root or slot with the canonical_beacon_block table to get the block data for each block."
