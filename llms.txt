# Xatu Dataset Guide

Note: When querying data, you must use the partitioning column as a filter to avoid querying too much data. This is extremely important and can be the difference between a query that runs in seconds and one that runs for hours.


## Dataset Overview

Xatu data contains information about the Ethereum network, organized into different datasets.
- Xatu is a data collection and processing pipeline for Ethereum network data.
- Xatu contains multiple "modules" that each derive Ethereum data differently. This data is then forwarded on to a data pipeline, and stored in a Clickhouse database.
  - Some community members and researchers have access to this Clickhouse database
- ethPandaOps maintains the project, while also running a semi public data pipeline for users to contribute to.
- The data is then openly published to Parquet files with a 1 to 3 day delay with a few columns redacted for privacy.
